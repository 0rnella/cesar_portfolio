The previous website had not been answering the stakeholders' needs, so over a period of 6 months, I was tasked with building a new site architecture, design and aesthetic to respond to all users' expectations.\nThe site was built on Wordpress with an eye towards maintainability, using Beaver Builder to fully control the design of the site. It is also mobile-responsive, with some adaptive elements (such as a hamburger menu), and it is navigable despite its dozens of pages thanks to navigation breadcrumbs.",
